I initially started the course part-time as a member of Evening Cohort 11 while I continued to work full time. I was already certain going into the course that this was the next direction I wanted to take, but I soon experienced the reawakening of a deep passion for web development that had long been set aside since childhood. It felt like I was being reunited with an old friend and I was ready to put all my chips in and do whatever it took to make this forgotten dream a reality. After completing the front-end section of the course in July of this year, I transferred to Cohort 40 as a full-time student and began taking a deep dive into Python / Django for my back-end studies. I find that web development allows me to thrive in the same way that music does: by allowing me to combine analytic, problem solving with creativity. At the end of the day, I hope to use my skills in both areas to enhance the lives of others.</p>",
