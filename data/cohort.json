It felt like I was being reunited with an old friend and I was ready to put all my chips in and do whatever it took to make this forgotten dream a reality. After completing the front-end section of the course in July of this year, I transferred to Cohort 40 as a full-time student and began taking a deep dive into Python / Django for my back-end studies. I find that web development allows me to thrive in the same way that music does: by allowing me to combine analytic, problem solving with creativity.
