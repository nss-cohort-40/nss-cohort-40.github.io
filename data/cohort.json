After working closely with the development team, I realized that I wanted to use software to solve problems, invent new products and services, and improve efficiency. I decided to pursue a career in technology by enrolling in the Software Engineering program at Arizona State University. Later, I accelerated my career by enrolling in Nashville Software School, a Full Stack Software Development bootcamp in Nashville, TN. I am passionate about ongoing learning, problem-solving, teamwork, and collaboration. I am excited to find new ways to leverage technology to develop new products and services. Outside of my coursework at Nashville Software School, I am learning Swift and iOS development. </p>",
